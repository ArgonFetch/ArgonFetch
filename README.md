## 📦 Installation

### Preparations:

- For Spotify Support you'll need to [create an App using Spotify for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/apps).
  From there you'll get a Client ID and a Client Secret, which you will have to provide during the install.

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)
1. Clone the repository:
  ```sh
  # Download Source
  curl -fsSL -o argonfetch.tar.gz https://github.com/ArgonFetch/ArgonFetch/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz
  # Unpack Source, remove tar and cd into the source directory
  tar -xzf argonfetch.tar.gz
  rm argonfetch.tar.gz
  cd ArgonFetch-main
  ```

2. Run the setup script:
   
   **Linux/macOS:**
   ```sh
   # Make the script executable
   chmod +x setup.sh
   
   # Run interactively (you'll be prompted for credentials)
   ./setup.sh
   ```
   
   **Windows (PowerShell):**
   ```powershell   
   # Run interactively (you'll be prompted for credentials)
   .\setup.ps1
   ```

After the installation, ArgonFetch should be accessible at http://localhost:8080.

## 🛠️ Usage
